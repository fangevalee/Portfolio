# Data science portfolio by Eva Lee
This portfolio contains my Data Science and Data Analysis projects for academic , self-learning and hobby purposes.

### [Analysis on Japanese Web Novel Title Length and its Impact on Popularity](https://github.com/fangevalee/Portfolio/blob/fd15c23a9ebd37221323ae1e8295ae498ce32a3b/WebNovel/WebNovelAnalysis.md)
* Scraped data from a Japanese web novel platform using the Selenium package in Python
* Created data visualizations with Tableau
* Used regression analysis to study the effect of having a longer title on the amount of views, bookmarks, written reviews, and average rating of a web novel<br>

The data visualizations show that the average title length of Japanese web novels has been increasing over time and fantasy novels have longer titles than other genres.
The regression results show that longer titles have a positive effect on the number of bookmarks, the number of unique viewers in one week, and the number of written reviews a web novel receives. Longer titles also have a negative effect on the average rating of the novel.<br>


### [Classification: Bank Marketing Data](https://github.com/fangevalee/Portfolio/blob/main/notebook/Bank%20Marketing.ipynb) 
Used logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, neural network, and support vector machine to predict if a client will make a subscription and compared the accuracy of the predictions. The highest accuracy was 0.88742674.<br>

*Tools Used: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn*
