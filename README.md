# Data science portfolio by Eva Lee
This portfolio contains my Data Science and Data Analysis projects for academic , self-learning and hobby purposes.

### [Analysis on Japanese Web Novel Title Length and its Impact on Popularity](https://github.com/fangevalee/Portfolio/blob/872ab071ec47fc2b2d1fa99945b2145d41477f60/WebNovel/WebNovelAnalysis.md)
* Scraped data from a Japanese web novel platform using the Selenium package in Python
* Used robust linear regression and quantile regression to estimate the effect of having a longer title on the number of bookmarks and average rating of a web novel<br>
* Used logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors to predict if the author will stop working on the novel.


### [Classification: Bank Marketing Data](https://github.com/fangevalee/Portfolio/blob/main/notebook/Bank%20Marketing.ipynb) 
Used logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, neural network, and support vector machine to predict if a client will make a subscription and compared the accuracy of the predictions. The highest accuracy was 0.88742674.<br>

*Tools Used: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn*
