### [Analysis on Japanese Web Novel Title Length](https://github.com/fangevalee/Portfolio/blob/970c2bc7387c3ecbd3b6b9382432bd9b82eb36ba/WebNovel/WebNovelAnalysis.md)
In this project, I used OLS regression to study the effect of having a longer title on the amount of views, bookmarks, and written reviews received by the web novel. The data I used was collected from Syosetsu.com, the largest web novel platform in Japan, using the selenium package in Python, and I created some data visualizations in Tableau in order to better understand the data.<br>
The regression results show that longer titles have a statistically significant positive effect on the number of bookmarks and written reviews a web novel receives. Title length might also have a positive effect on the number of weekly views and a negative effect on the rating of the novel.


### [Bank Marketing Data](https://github.com/fangevalee/Portfolio/blob/main/notebook/Bank%20Marketing.ipynb) 
In this project, I used logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, neural network, and support vector machine to predict if a client will make a subscription and compared the results. The highest accuracy I got was 0.88742674.
