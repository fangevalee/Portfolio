# Analysis on Japanese Web Novel Title Length

## Abstract
Web Novels in Japan are known to have long titles, and many believe it is because longer titles give readers more context about the story, which makes the readers more willing to give the novel a try. I collected data from Syosetsu.com, the largest web novel platform in Japan, and used OLS regression to find title lengthâ€™s effects on weekly viewers, average rating, number of bookmarks, and number of written reviews. The regression results show that longer titles have a positive effect on the number of bookmarks and written reviews a web novel receives. Title length might also have a positive effect on the number of weekly views and a negative effect on the rating of the novel.

## Introduction
#### What is a Web Novel?
A web novel is a work of fiction that is published on the Internet. Web novels are written mainly by indie writers and published in a serialized format, and most of them are available to readers free of charge. An example of an English web novel platform is Wattpad. Many web novels have become published books during the past decade, and some famous works have been adapted into anime, drama, and movies.
#### What is interesting about web novel in Japan?
One interesting fact about web novels in Japan is that they are known for their long titles, and many people have noticed that web novel titles are getting longer and longer. Some people claim that longer titles can lead to more views because longer titles give the readers more context about the plot. Since some platforms do not show the abstract of the novel in the search result by default, titles become the only way for writers to showcase what their stories are about.
